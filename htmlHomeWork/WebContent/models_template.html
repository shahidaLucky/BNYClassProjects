                <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements.
                <strong>Block level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while 
                <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.<br></p>
                
                <p>In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
                
                <p>In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML.
                 There are seven main models:<b> Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.</b> To learn more about them,
